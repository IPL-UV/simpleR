Thank you so much for wanting to give back to the toolbox. Here's some info on how to contribute:

#General:
 
Don't bunch up changes, e.g. if you have bug-fixes, new features and style changes, rather make 3 seperate pull requests.

Ensure that you introduce tests/examples for any new functionality

# Guide
1. Fork repository
2. Create a new branch, e.g. `checkout -b my-stuff`
3. Commit and push your changes to that branch
4. Make sure that the test works (!) (see known errors)
5. Create a pull request
6. I accept your pull request
